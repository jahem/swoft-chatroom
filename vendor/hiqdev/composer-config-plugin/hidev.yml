        This [Composer] plugin provides assembling
        of configurations distributed with composer packages.
        This allows to put configuration needed to use package right inside of
        the package thus implementing plugin system: package becomes a plugin
        holding both the code and it's configuration.

        How it works?

        - scans installed packages for `config-plugin` extra option in their
          `composer.json`
        - loads `dotenv` files to set `$_ENV` variables
        - requires `defines` files to set constants
        - requires `params` files
        - requires config files
        - options collected on earlier steps could and should be used in later
          steps, e.g. `$_ENV` should be used for constants and parameters, which
          in turn should be used for configs
        - files processing order is crucial to achieve expected behavior: options
          in root package have priority over options from included packages, more
          about it see below in **Files processing order** section
        - collected configs are written as PHP files in
          `vendor/hiqdev/composer-config-plugin-output`
          directory along with information needed to rebuild configs on demand
        - then assembled configs can be loaded into application with `require`
